This backend is written in typescript, and uses express to handle the API and postgresql to store the data, with prisma as the ORM.

# 1. Installation for development

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then create a .env file with the following variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://test:test@localhost:5432/reladb"
```

You can configure the default user's username and password with these variables, and they need to correspond to the ones your database has. You can use the [docker-compose.yml](database/docker-compose.yml) file to create a database with the correct user and password.

You can then launch the database from the database folder:

```bash
cd database
mkdir db # only the first time
docker-compose up -d
```

Then create the db schema with prisma :

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

You can seed the database with some data (for testing purposes):

```bash
npm run seed
```

Finally, you can launch the backend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The script [start_dev](start_dev.sh) will launch the server with the database at the same time.
